# 2D Elastic Collision Simulator (Processing)

This repository contains the source code (`.pde` files) for my 2D elastic collision simulator, written in [Processing](https://processing.org/).  
I built this project to deepen my understanding of classical mechanics and computational physics, and it is featured on my resume.

## Overview
- Simulates collisions between multiple discs with different radii, masses, and velocities.  
- Implements perfectly elastic collisions (coefficient of restitution = 1).  
- Uses spatial partitioning for efficiency (hashmap-based).  
- Visualizes motion and collisions in real time.  

## Notes
- This repo stores only the Processing source files.  
- Exported executables (`.exe`, `application.*` folders, etc.) are intentionally excluded.
